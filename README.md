## Notes

OpenWeatherMap API key is stored in environment files. 
I acknowledge that, for commercial projects and to enhance the security of the application's build process, these keys should be provided as distinct parameters.
For instance, they can be included in the Jenkins configuration file that outlines the application's build procedure.
